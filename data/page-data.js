		"description": "Jay Jackson is a musician, comedian, actor, and producer based in Little Rock. Darius Rucker tweeted him once (true story), so he's a pretty big deal in Nashville. He's released six music albums, including the soul-inspired <i>Clockwork Neon</i> and rock-infused <i>Envy the Faithful</i>; you haven't heard them, but your hipster brother-in-law won't shut up about how great they are. Jay co-hosted <i>The Broadway Joe Morning Show</i> on Power 92.3 FM, the #1 rated urban morning talk show in Arkansas. He was also a regular guitarist and piano player at Willy Ds Piano Bar until the infamous &ldquo;Rubber Chicken Incident&rdquo;. Jay appeared in the 2016 Arkansas Times Musician Showcase, the 2016 Loony Bin Comedy Competition, and hosted the 2017 Little Rock World Series of Comedy. He  is co-creator, director, and editor the action-comedy web series \"Grundy & Stone,\" in which he also plays the role of Sgt. Stone and serves as executive producer – and boy, are his arms tired.<br /><br />Jay has hosted and produced numerous shows, including the <i>Comedy Cage Match</i> monthly variety show and the Rogue Revue.  He currently produces Little Rock's <i>Nasty Women of Comedy</i> and is trying to catch up on editing his Rogue Radio podcast (Season III will begin one of these days, he promises). He is working on his seventh studio music album tentatively entitled <i>Love, and Other Lies</i>. Jay is also a member of the <a href='http://theveteransofcomedy.com/' target='_blank'>Veterans of Comedy</a>, and his first comedy album, <i>Black Power Bottom</i>, is set for a late 2018 release."
