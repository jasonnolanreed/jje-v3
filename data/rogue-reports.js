Looking back on the set now, it’s odd how far ahead of his time Carlin actually was (he cracked wise about redneck fundamentalists a full 16 years before the Bundy Bunch raided a federal bird sanctuary for snacks). It was also the first time I’d encountered the profanity-laden, “irreverent” style that would go on to influence Doug Stanhope, Bill Burr, and countless open mic comics who want to be “edgy” shock performers. Carlin didn’t really tell jokes; he just pointed out our own hypocrisies in the most absurd, vulgar manner he could think of, threw in a little wordplay, and it just happened to be funny. I could never imitate his style even if I wanted to; I’m not full of that much piss and vinegar.

I wished I could spin a yarn half as good as Ron White could. In fact, when I first started stand-up, I emulated almost everything about him: the demeanor, the persona, the drinking, the standing in place, the accent, all that. Eventually I grew out of that phase (and not a moment too soon, thank GAWD), but it's a lesson that has stuck with me, and there are still elements of my storytelling to this day that have that White-esque cadence.",

But at the end of it, I pitied poor Mike. I wanted to give him a hug. At the end of 'What I Should Have Said...', I felt like I'd made a friend. Almost every story, from living in the shadow of a more popular older brother to dealing with your own inadequacies as a performer to just saying the wrong thing at the wrong time, was something I related to personally. Birbiglia's whole schtick is finding the hilariously beautiful moments his personal pain and getting the audience to empathize.

And his prowess at classical piano was unmatched. For me, a sheltered deacon's kid who learned to play piano in church, seeing this show for the first time as a kid set off a light in my mind. Music didn't have to be sad or serious; it could be hilarious. But more than that, he was the first performer I saw who was the total package.
